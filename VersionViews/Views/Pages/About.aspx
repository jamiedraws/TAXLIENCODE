            <p>Progressive was co-founded in January 2007 by investor-entrepreneurs Mark Homer and Rob Moore.</p>
            <p>Progressive was largely an accident: the founders only had intentions to build their own property portfolio. But once they achieved income and freedom in their 20s, people kept asking for their strategies and secrets. Fast forward to now and Progressive is the UK's largest, yet still most personal property education company.</p>
            <p>The Progressive story has built over nearly 15 years, and endured a recession and full market cycle, where many went under. Originally a property company to buy and own properties for the founders, it evolved into a property sourcing company when the demand for property and the founders' experience grew. Progressive has sourced almost 1,000 properties for the founders and investors.</p>
            <p>Progressive then innovated the property education space. First the UK's best selling property book which opened the minds of the masses to property, and now 800 training days a year on multiple streams of property income, many from the Progressive training academy HQ in Peterborough, that the founders own.</p>
            <p>Once the founders had sourced around 300 properties, Progressive Lets was formed in 2012, as a byproduct of owning and managing so many properties. Progressive Lets now manages nearly 1,000 properties, has a boutique sourcing arm, and manages many serviced accommodation and multi-let properties too; living the Progressive values of innovative and personal.</p>
            <p>Property is not just a strategy, but a lifestyle. It is not just a skillset, but a mindset. Rob Moore began to specialise in the personal development side of property as Mark continued heading up their acquisitions. Mark is currently developing around 200 units for their personal portfolio, and Progressive bought a struggling personal development business in 2009, which they turned around, renamed &ldquo;Unlimited Success&rdquo; and grew into an 8 figure business by 2016. This company has now merged into the Progressive brand, now known as &ldquo;Progressive Success&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>The next stage of growth and innovation for Progressive is global scale. Progressive Property Network (PPN) events are located throughout the UK, and Progressive has new events launching in 6 countries across 4 continents.</p>
            <p>Progressive have also hosted the UK's flagship property events the &ldquo;Property SuperConferences&rdquo;, won Property Wire business of the year award in 2016 & &ldquo;Property Community of the year&rdquo; in 2018. Progressive have trained many of the newer property education companies and have helped 10,000s of people in all walks of life and UK towns and cities on their journey towards freedom, choice and profit through multiple streams of property income.</p>
            <p>Progressive's head office based in Peterborough, where a team of 80 staff; Progressive Property 'intrapreneurs' to help property investors across the country to increase their portfolios, to learn the systems that worked so well for Rob and Mark, and to inspire education and action in the property community.</p>
