                        <p>Over the next 5 years he went on to build a &pound;5M+ property portfolio with a monthly positive cashflow of over &pound;20k per month. He uses creative strategies such as Rent2Rent, Lease Options, Assisted Sales, Vendor Finance, JV Finance and Rent2Own.</p>

                        <p>Kevin has been investing in property since 1991 when he bought his first Buy-to-Let at the age of 20. After leaving the British Army in 2011 he had a portfolio of Buy-to-Let&rsquo;s and HMO&rsquo;s worth over a million pounds, and due to this income did not need to get a job and has gone on to build a portfolio worth in excess of 3 million pounds.</p>
                        <p>Kevin now specialises in Serviced Accommodation, and Rent-to-Rent Serviced Accommodation.</p>

                        <p>Anne began investing in property in 2001. And to start with it was an enjoyable hobby that she had alongside her day job as a dentist. In 2014 she discovered Progressive Property and her whole world changed forever. She now owns over 60 properties with her husband Steve and a further 8 with her Joint Venture partners.</p>
                        <p>They're a mix of single lets and HMOs with a value of over &pound;6 million. She is also investing in Commercial Conversion Projects and runs her own Lettings agency! Her last day as a dentist was 1st September 2015 and she now gets to spend her "work" time (because it really doesn&rsquo;t feel like work) investing in property and training other people to become financially free through property.</p>

                        <p>A former Royal Navy communicator, Dan has worked hard to build a hugely successful Serviced Accommodation business, operating through Greater London, The Cotswolds and South Wales. After beginning a family, Dan decided to leave the Royal Navy, as it was taking him away from home too often.</p>
                        <p>After working in the corporate world, Dan discovered that his family time was still too limited. Progressive Property&rsquo;s masterclass event opened up a whole new realm of income possibilities to Dan, who decided upon the Serviced Accommodation strategy because of the areas in which he wished to operate. Dan needed a "high cashflow in&rdquo; strategy that worked in his local area, and Serviced Accommodation fit the bill perfectly.</p>
                        <p>Dan used his rent-to-SA business in order to slowly leverage his way to developing and evolving his business to include many different remits. He won Progressive VIP of the Year award back in 2018 and now owns successful businesses Pivotal Point Properties &amp; Cheltenham Serviced Apartments which have allowed him to become financially free and have more time to spend with his family.</p>
