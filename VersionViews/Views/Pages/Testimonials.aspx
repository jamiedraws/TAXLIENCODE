                        <p>&ldquo;It was love at first post with Rob Moore, I admired him for actually posting on Facebook and building a personal rapport. I&rsquo;ve attended TAXLIENCODE, JV, HMO, 12 month VIP Mentorship Kryptonite and Elite Speaking Revolution.</p>
                        <p>In the 5 years since attending TAXLIENCODE I have met some amazing people, avoided a number of mistakes, gained a respectable reputation in the industry, had dinner with Rob Moore and finally given up employment to go self-employed. Progressive Property gave me the knowledge and network to make some bold personal and business decisions.</p>
                        <p>Before attending the courses I had a near death experience in 2014 with Sepsis. I stared the devil in the face and won! This was the wake up call I needed to do something to create a different income stream.</p>
                        <p>I had a regular 9-5 job, but felt stuck in a career that had lost its appeal and had very little time to do my charity work. I also care for my 2 children with a very rare health condition. There are only 200 children/people in the UK with this condition &ndash; cystinosis.</p>
                        <p>After the courses I felt nervous and unsure about meeting new people, had anxiety when speaking in public and lacked the confidence in believing in myself. I wobbled a lot in my mindset and doubted my investment in training, but Progressive helped me overcome all of this.</p>
                        <p>Now, I&rsquo;m at the stage where I can balance my time between family, property, architectural design and charity work. And, I was awarded the Queens Award for Voluntary Services in 2019.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;I came to the TAXLIENCODE event and knew I wanted to be the best in SA so had to sign up. When I signed up for the course I was in a total panic and had no idea how I would pay for it!</p>
                        <p>I loved the positive energy and great advice given by so many knowledgeable people already doing SA and that had come from hard backgrounds. The course gave me massive confidence to go and get my 1st R2SA plus the background knowledge to take on managed properties.</p>
                        <p>Because I got myself even more into debt when signing up, this was a massive incentive to go full on into getting more properties and build my income. The knowledge, support and guidance from the trainers has definitely helped my mindset to push ahead even when it got really hard.</p>
                        <p>Before attending the course I was at an all time low. Recently divorced, with my equestrian business of nearly 20 years failing, I was in a lot of debt and felt completely lost. I was working 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, with little money, I had to borrow money from family and credit cards to keep afloat and was struggling. I needed more income, something that would give me money for my future, stability and pension as well as more free time.</p>
                        <p>Channel managers were one of the biggest challenges for me. I went through 4 to get to the one I now have and remember being sat on the floor crying many times trying to get them to work! COVID also hit just 4 months after I had started my business and I honestly thought I would be bankrupt at the end of April 2020.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve survived near bankruptcy, divorce and COVID to be earning more than I ever have in my life, and all in less than 18 months. I&rsquo;m now at a completely different place. I have never earned so much money in my life, don&rsquo;t get me wrong this has not been an easy journey but you just have to keep going no matter how hard, and it does work!!&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Bloody hell! Where do I begin!? Just got home from TAXLIENCODE. Another amazing 3 days. Met so many amazing people, including the legendary trainers!</p>
                        <p>Got the privilege of sitting directly in front of Rob Moore whilst he answered questions.</p>
                        <p>A week after doing No money down. I went straight to a portfolio landlord who offered me 28 properties to lease and received some great advice on the deal from Kevin J McDonnell</p>
                        <p>So on the way home I rang the investor and sorted out the next steps and business plan</p>
                        <p>What a busy 12 days! Ps love the stripes&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;1 week after the combined R2R and NMD course, and with me immediately signing up for the NMD mastermind, I have now secured my first property - an EDC in east London! Thanks to Kevin McDonnell&rsquo;s personal guidance I have managed to secure the property at an extremely good price given the area, and really helped out the vendor in the process. Negotiated on Friday over the phone followed by an email summarising the offer (making sure to package the &lsquo;pain with the pleasure&rsquo; as Kevin says, and breaking down all the figures plainly for the vendor) - by Sunday at midnight she emailed to say she was all in.</p>
                        <p>Looking forward to securing many more in east London in the near future. What I have learned and continue to learn is priceless.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;What a massive difference property has made to my life. Not only am I in love with what I do and making good money but the biggest thing for me is the network which I like to call my property family.</p>
                        <p>I've just spent two days in London and travelled down on my own knowing I have so many wonderful friends and contacts where ever I go that means I will not be alone. In fact it's been crazy I haven't even had chance to catch up with everyone I intended to so apologies</p>
                        <p>I've had great times with my friends and also met new investors and have some very exciting opportunities in the pipeline.</p>
                        <p>Wow what a time I've had. Thank you to Rebecca Smith David Siegler and Rob Moore for inspiring me from the beginning .&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Rob, I currently have 3 different six figure businesses as well as the 7 figure commercial rental business. So spinning plates can be difficult particularly during the last 12 months of COVID which has had a big impact on our restaurant business and rental business.</p>
                        <p>Diversifying into the podcast and consultancy business has helped on a number of levels. Without the support and accountability of yourself and the Podcast Mastermind I would still be talking about doing it. My own mindset &amp;buying a 35,000ft2 building in 6 weeks with private money was a challenge, but I did it. Thank you!"</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re currently on the progressive VIP and marketing mastermind. We have learnt about how to leverage, and run a systemised business. Rob has helped us level up our marketing which has enabled us to achieve 700 investors for our property sourcing company. Specifically, Rob has helped me focus on my target market. We now spend time on things that bring in income, which is allowing us to scale.</p>
                        <p>But it hasn&rsquo;t come without it&rsquo;s challenges:</p>
                        <p>Cashflow has been a difficult hurdle to overcome. We didn&rsquo;t start with a large pot of capital (only 10k), so to get where we are in one year has been super challenging. The second is mindset. We lacked the mindset to scale at the beginning because we didn&rsquo;t test and implement the right strategies. Robs training has allowed us to focus and therefore spend time on what truly matters in our business.</p>
                        <p>And on our ever first project we hired a builder who was a &lsquo;friend of a friend&rsquo; who did our first ever refurb. He did a runner and cost us 12k overall in damages. Falsified damp work, and took his second instalment and left us high and dry. We didn&rsquo;t vet him properly, and we didn&rsquo;t have the systems and processes in place to avoid such a risk for our business. We learnt this the hard way.&rdquo;</p>
